# Compute the PageRank scores on the given dataset

Dataset: Data.txt

The format of the lines in the file is as follow:
FromNodeID ToNodeID

In this project, you need to report the Top 100 NodeID with their PageRank scores. You
can choose different parameters, such as the teleport parameter, to compare different results.

One result you must report is that when setting the teleport parameter to 0.85.

In addition to the basic PageRank algorithm, you need to implement the Block-Stripe
Update algorithm.
